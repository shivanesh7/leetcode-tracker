**Difficulty:** Medium  
[View on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-area-rectangle/)

---

You are given an array of points in the **X-Y** plane `points` where `points[i] = [x_i, y_i]`.

Return *the minimum area of a rectangle formed from these points, with sides parallel to the X and Y axes*. If there is not any such rectangle, return `0`.
